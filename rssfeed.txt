			<title>Can UP become 'Uttam Pradesh'? Four key challenges before Modi</title>
			<description>By: James Owen  Much of the commentary around the BJP’s stunning victory in Uttar Pradesh has involved the prospect of Prime Minister Narendra Modi deploying his renewed political capital to improve India’s business environment. But what does the win mean for UP itself?  For all its political heft, the state remains an economic outlier, with a percapita income of Rs 40,373 ($620) a year, around half the national average. Indeed, the PM’s tweet on March 11 —“When UP develops, India develops” — hinted at the untapped economic potential of India’s most populous state. He also promised to transform Uttar Pradesh into ‘Uttam Pradesh’ — India’s ‘best state’.  Caste Order Now Outcaste One explanation for why UP continues to be an economic laggard is the culture of political patronage prevalent in the state, although this is not unique to UP. The emergence of regional parties such as the Samajwadi Party (SP) and the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) in the 1990s saw political parties increasingly appealing to caste, religious and sub-regional aspirations, undermining wider progress.  The BJP’s ability to override the state’s caste-based political order in the recent elections provides it with a unique opportunity to stimulate statewide socioeconomic development.  The state has a number of natural advantages. For one, it has one of the largest pools of semi-skilled and unskilled labour, ideally positioning it for labour-intensive manufacturing envisioned in Modi’s ‘Make in India’ initiative. In addition, with a population close to Brazil’s, UP provides companies such as those in the agro-processing and consumer-focused segments access to the largest untapped consumer base in the country.  Despite these advantages, UP has been largely overlooked by foreign investors, who are wary of the significant political, security and compliance risks entailed in conducting business in the state. In September 2016, the Singapore-based Asian Competitiveness Institute ranked UP the most difficult state to do business in. The new state government will need to address four major challenges to realise Modi’s pitch for development in UP.  Lack of Physical Infrastructure, Specifically Access to Electricity UP was ranked in the 2011 Census to be the lowest among the states, with only 36.8% of households having access to electricity. Although the BJP victory is likely to improve policy coordination between the federal and state governments, reforming the finances of the state electricity board will remain politically challenging. Increasing tariffs will dampen public support for the government, but will be essential to reducing operating losses of the utilities and stimulating investments in the state electricity grid, which would, in turn, open up significant opportunities for the manufacturing and allied sectors.   Now to open Sesame Social Fault Lines Other than policy predictability, investors prefer a stable and secure operating environment. Incidents such as the 2013 Hindu-Muslim riots in the western districtof Muzaffarnagar, which left at least 62 people dead and rendered hundreds homeless, have contributed to UP’s dubious reputation of being a highly-charged communal cauldron, which has acted as a significant barrier for major foreign investments. The BJP’s ability to appeal to a large cross-section of disparate social, religious and caste-based groups in these elections affords it a unique opportunity to bridge some of these social fault lines. It can now also avoid socially divisive issues, such as building the Ram temple in Ayodhya.  Grime and Punishment  Crime and Politics: According to data from the National Crime Records Bureau for 2015, the crime rate in UP was twice the national average. The problem was reflected in the fact that almost a quarter of the candidates fielded in these elections have serious criminal charges against them, according to data compiled by the Association for Democratic Reforms. Extortion and violent crime are of particular concern for businesses, especially those engaged in politically exposed sectors such as infrastructure and alcohol. The new government will need to strengthen local law enforcement and curb the influence of gangs in order to provide a secure environment for businesses.  Corruption Although there have been no headline-making corruption scandals at the federal level since the BJP has come to power at the Centre in 2014, corruption at the local level, especially in states like UP, remains endemic and poses significant integrity risks to businesses. This is especially true for foreign companies, which increasingly have to comply with tough international anti-corruption frameworks such as the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and the UK Bribery Act. Such extraterritorial laws make these companies extremely wary of investing in states with high levels of corruption like UP.  The state’s perception of the demonetisation exercise rolled out in November 2016 as a well-intentioned anti-corruption measure played a part in the BJP’s strong performance. This anti-corruption drive needs to be taken ahead in the state by increasing transparency in bureaucratic procedures and licensing requirements.  Despite the BJP making gradual improvements to the business environment at the federal level, there have been significant regional variations in the operating environment in different states, with UP’s development stunted by the policies of its previous governments.  With the BJP now in power both in the state as well as nationally, it is well-positioned to address some of these structural challenges and achieve Modi’s vision of transforming Uttar Pradesh into India’s ‘best state’.

			<title>India ready for NSG membership: Trump regime backs India, leaves policy unchanged</title>
			<description>NEW DELHI: The Donald Trump administration for the first time since taking over this January has endorsed India’s quest for membership into the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) besides two other export control regimes — Australia Group and Wassenar Group.  A US State Department official has said that Washington believes that India is ready for NSG membership in what can be described as taking forward moves made by the Obama administration to push India’s case in the exclusive club.  These remarks assume significance ahead of the US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson’s visit to Beijing with China being the biggest roadblock to India’s entry into the NSG club.  The US official informed that Washington, working with India and Nuclear Suppliers Group members to push for New Delhi’s membership in the elite grouping, indicate that there is no change in America’s policy on the issue under the Trump regime.  “The United States supports India’s full membership in the four multilateral export control regimes, and we believe that India is ready for the NSG membership,” according to a State Department spokesperson.  India outsmarted China to become member of Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) last year. This has allowed India and its partners Russia and Israel to increase the range of jointly developed missiles including Brahmos.  China is not yet a member of MTCR. The spokesperson was responding to questions on Wednesday on the position of the Trump administration on India’s bid to be a member of the 48-member Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG).  The US and India have been working on this issue since the Bush presidency. Despite its best efforts, the Obama administration could not get the job done due to opposition from China, but the onus is now on the Trump administration to see it through.  “We have worked and continue to work closely with our Indian counterparts and the NSG Participating Governments to help advance India’s case for membership,” the State Department official said.  The key to India’s membership now lies with China. India had reiterated its desire to enter NSG based on its credentials during the Sino-Indian strategic dialogue in Beijing last month.  But it is not clear if Tillerson, who would be in China this week, would be raising this issue with the Chinese leadership or if President Donald Trump is ready to take up the issue himself as was done by President George Bush.  Trump will host his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping in Florida next month. In January, the then South and Central Asia point person of the Obama administration, Nisha Desai Biswal, had described China as an “outlier” as it is denying India the membership.  </description>

			<title>In the season of pink slips, startups are still the place to start your career. Here's why</title>
			<description>NEW DELHI | MUMBAI: What's your business model? What is the value of equity being given? What's your customer-acquisition cost?  These aren't questions investors are putting to startup founders. Instead, they are being fired at them by people that startups are looking to hire, during and before job interviews.  "Potential recruits are asking us the same questions as investors. The people who are applying now are much smarter," said Mohit Gundecha, founder, Jombay, a talent assessment startup that has 50 employees and plans to add 25 more this year.  In the season of pink slips on startup job street, it's not all darkness and despair. Employment experts and startup veterans say the churn is merely the wheat getting separated from the chaff. For the right talent, it still makes sense to bet on a career in startups, they argue.  PwC started an independent cluster on startups to spot the next set of unicorns among the new-age companies six months ago. The firm has identified 15-20 people across locations in India to keep an eye on those startups that have potential to scale.  The startup story is still going strong, said Abhishek Goenka, the PwC partner leading the initiative.These companies are typically in angel investment stage. Some of these are doing cutting-edge work in the field of tech, robotics, artificial intelligence and high-end manufacturing. "We are betting big on startups and it makes sense for talent to join startups — it still looks good on your CV," Goenka said.   MakeMyTrip group CEO Deep Kalra said the average age of an employee in a startup is somewhere in the mid-20s, implying that younger and less experienced but highly talented professionals are getting the opportunity to work on and manage critical areas. Not something that happens in a conventional, mature company where years of experience matter more. "Of course, jobseekers, while evaluating startups as potential workplaces, must evaluate the company, its values, financial situation etc., but this temporary phase must not deter them from deciding to work in a startup," he said.  Gazal Kalra, co-founder of Rivigo, agreed. The surface transport logistics provider, which raised $75 million from private equity firm Warburg Pincus in November, is still actively hiring, both laterals as well as on campus. Kalra said she has been surprised by the perceptive questions being asked by potential hires, something that didn't happen even a few months earlier.  "Startups provide an unparalleled opportunity in terms of the quality of work, sense of impact and early exposure to the leadership team," she said. "Those factors still hold true. What has changed in a big way is that candidates are now doing much more research into the background of startups."  The good thing is that such candidates understand the fundamentals of the business. "It's no longer a fashion to join. The ones who are evaluating the move are more serious about the opportunity and the role as well," she said.  Investors said startups will continue to create jobs and that now's a good time as any to get in. Funding deals may have declined in the recent past, but the startup story is far from over. ET reported recently that a new wave of small Japanese investors is scouting in India for early stage startups, signaling a return of confidence.  Also, while the likes of Snapdeal, PropTiger and Craftsvilla may be making headlines for their recent layoffs, a bunch of other big and small players including Flipkart, Amazon, Paytm, Ola, Uber,Portea Medical, Rivigo and Swiggy are looking to hire.  According to Krishnan Ganesh, serial entrepreneur and partner, GrowthStory, both the euphoria of two years ago and the current gloom are overstated from the point of view of investors, entrepreneurs and employees joining the startup ecosystem. The truth is somewhere in between, he said.  The sector has created millions of jobs, whether direct or indirect. Compared with this, the layoffs are in the thousands, he said.  "It is established everywhere that the real new job creation will happen not in traditional sectors, but in this new-age and small companies. You will miss out on huge opportunities if you get affected by all the noise. It's suicidal for the youth to get swayed — they need to get into where the jobs are," Ganesh said.  Putting things in perspective is important, he pointed out.  "One of the reasons why things seem so much worse than they actually are is because of the way we glamourised startups," he said. "L&amp;T alone laid off so many, so many textile industry workers got wiped out but there wasn’t so much hype."  Investors and startup founders feel that lessons have been learnt from the mistakes of the past.  "I still feel joining at an early stage startup with strong fundamentals is a good idea," said Gazal Kalra. "Otherwise, what we have seen in the past is that startups which have scaled up really fast have had this tendency to throw people at problems, instead of trying the fix the problem itself. That is changing."  </description>

			<title>Enemy Property Bill to bring windfall of Rs 1 lakh cr </title>
			<description>ET Intelligence Group: The passing of the Enemy Property (Amendment and Validation) Bill 2016 by both houses of parliament paves the way for the government to monetise assets worth more than Rs 1 lakh crore, which will come as a nice cushion at a time when the government is looking at ways to control the fiscal deficit.  The amendment now empowers the Custodian of Enemy Property (CEP) to sell such assets, which wasn't permitted under the old Enemy Property Act, 1968. The official, appointed under the 1968 Act, was entrusted with the custody, management and administration of assets deemed enemy property after the India-China war of 1962 and the wars with Pakistan in 1965 and 1971. The authority, under the home ministry, can now sell these properties.  Data provided in the report of the parliament select committee on the bill released in May last year reveals that there are 9,280 immovable properties belonging to Pakistani nationals encompassing 11,882 acres. The total value of immovable properties that are vested with the custodian stood at Rs 1.04 lakh crore. Movable vested properties consist of shares in 266 listed companies valued at Rs 2,610 crore; shares in 318 unlisted companies valued at Rs 24 crore; gold and jewellery worth Rs 0.4 crore; bank balances of Rs 177 crore; investment in government securities of Rs 150 crore and investment in fixed deposits of Rs 160 crore.  Besides this, there are 149 immovable enemy properties of Chinese nationals with the custodian in West Bengal, Assam, Meghalaya, Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Karnataka and Delhi.    An ET Intelligence Group investigation in 2008 had revealed that the shares vested with the custodian were in listed entities such as Wipro, Cipla ACC, Tata and DCM group companies, Bombay Burmah Trading Co., Ballarpur Industries, DLF, Hindustan Unilever, ITC, Bajaj Electricals, India Cement and Aditya Birla Nuvo.  "The custodian has the power to dispose or sell enemy property as well as to evict illegal occupants," said Bhupendra Yadav, member of parliament and chairman of the select committee on the amendment bill. This would also entail suitable amendments to the Public Premises (Eviction of Unauthorised Occupants) Act, 1971.  The amendment is retrospective in effect and bars any enemy or enemy firm from having any right of transfer of any property that is vested in the custodian. Civil courts are barred from adjudicating on matters pertaining to enemy properties with succession laws not applicable to these. The select committee report elaborates on the rationale of the amendment.  In the initial stages of the functioning of the custodian, courts upheld automatic vesting of enemy properties in the custodian and restrained themselves from interfering in the orders passed by the custodian. Later, however, there have been judgments by various courts--the union of India vs. Raja Mohammad Amir Mohammad Khan being the landmark one--that adversely affected the powers of the custodian as provided under the old Act.  Besides, according to the ministry of external affairs, the Pakistan government has disposed of all enemy properties in that country.  "Earlier, it used to be possible under Section 18 of the old Act that the property under the custodian could be divested and returned to the original owner or his legal heir," said Jatin Zaveri, a Supreme Court advocate. "However, by widening the definition of enemy to include legal representatives or heirs and including the new Section 8A that empowers the custodian to dispose of the enemy property vested in it, it is no longer possible to make claims on an enemy property and the government is free to dispose it off and monetise it."  The home ministry's annual report for 2015-16 states that the government has opened two new branch offices of the custodian at Lucknow and Delhi in 2014 and intends to detect more enemy properties in various states by conducting a countrywide survey. The survey has begun in Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Delhi, Madhya Pradesh and Kerala.  "To be sure, enemy property is different from evacuee property," said Yadav. While the former is the fallout of India's conflicts with China and Pakistan, the latter refers to assets abandoned at the time of partition.  The select committee report mentions the crucial vesting period for assets of Chinese nationals has been determined as running from from October 26, 1962, to January, 10, 1968, and that for the Pakistani nationals from September, 10, 1965, to September 26, 1977.  One of the recommendations of the select committee was that the process of identification of enemy properties should be completed within two years from the date of enactment of the amendment.  Immediately after the passage of the bill, the custodian should dispose of all non-contentious enemy properties without delay.</description>

			<title>Hiranandani looks to boost commercial realty portfolio</title>
			<description> MUMBAI: Realtor Hiranandani Group is looking to ramp up its commercial portfolio by 10-15% annually over the next five years through new projects. The Mumbai-based developer will be adding five million sq ft in the two years ending December 2017 in Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) and Ahmedabad. The group is also planning to develop a 250-acre industrial township in Talegaon in Pune and a 160-acre park in Chennai.  “We believe in the Prime Minister's vision of `Make In India', which will boost both industrial and commercial activity in India and therefore initiating the new industrial space building and growing the commercial footprint from our side. Apart from commercial development, we are also going to focus on industrial townships. We will be deve loping an industrial township on 250-acre land in Pune and 160 acres in Chennai,“ said Niranjan Hiranandani, CMD of Hiranandani Group of companies.  The company has already started the first phase of construction for the industrial township in Pune spread over 50 acres and is expected to be completed in four phases.It has also completed acquisition of 160-acre land for a similar project in Chennai. Currently, the group is developing nearly six million sq ft of commercial properties, including two million sq ft in Panvel and 3.5 million sq ft in Thane. A four-lakh sq ft project in GIFT SEZ in Gandhinagar is the latest addition to this portfolio.  “We have already leased 30% of Hiranandani Signature tower in GIFT City and hope to increase the occupancy to 85% by September. There are seven prominent banks which have shown interest in picking up office space. Demand for space here is high, given the tax benefits being offered,“ said Hiranandani.  The (BSE and Kotak Mahindra Bank are the anchor tenants at Hiranandani Signature tower with first and second floors, respectively. BSE Brokers Association has also picked up an entire floor spread over 28,000 sq ft. Re venues from businesses operating out of this tower will be tax free, except for a levy of minimum alternate tax (MAT) of 9%.  In 2016, the company concluded India's largest commercial space transaction for the year with two million sq ft built-to-suit office leased to software major Tata Consultancy Services (TCS).  It also concluded the largest commercial space divestment deal to a private equity when it sold 4.5 million sq ft office and retail space to Canada-based Brookfield Asset Management for $1 billion.</description>

			<title>Private equity players may flock to real estate market</title>
			<description>MUMBAI | BENGALURU: The big-ticket transition signalled through the Real Estate Regulatory Act (RERA), currency demonetisation and Goods and Services Tax is set to spell more opportunities for institutional capital in India's real estate sector. Private equity players, who have so far preferred the structured-debt route to invest in Indian property market, are likely to find the market even more transparent and attractive.  More foreign direct investment (FDI) can be expected through equity now as this will lead to an economy more aligned to global compliance standards, making investing easier for foreign entities.  "From a historic high seen in 2009, when the share of private equity inflows into residential real estate peaked to 60% of the overall pie, it has gradually reduced to 10% in 2016.This 10% figure is same as the investment split seen in 2006, which was the first time equity interest tracked into the residential asset class. Private equity investment was entirely focused on the commercial asset class in the initial few years," said Anuj Puri, chairman, JLL India.  "While the real estate business has currently taken a step back due to these, it will set a very strong foundation for long-term growth. Equity investments at such times can work extremely well for longterm investors," Puri said.  "Going forward, the nature of private equity participation in real estate will have to change significantly. Gone are the days of evaluating security values based on projected capital rates and cash flows in order to take secured debt positions.Taking these debt positions is no more risk free and returns are also diminishing as developers continue to shy away from high cost debt," said Rubi Arya, vice-chairman, Milestone Capital Advisors.  Private equity funds will have to increase their risk appetite as pure debt opportunities will not be available with good established brands. Taking structured equity or pure equity positions is the way for ward for higher returns.  Since high returns are linked to high risks, inherent knowledge, investment discipline and team strength will matter the most, Arya said.  Asset management companies need to be more and more hands-on with their knowledge of micro markets, project development and statutory aspects in particular.  In 2016, the trend of raising debt continued especially in the residential segment. Further leverage being limited, developers are likely to be open to providing entry points to the long-term equity investors.While a few equity-related risks would continue, attractive entry points will also provide a higher margin of safety.  "Both investors and developers will gain more confidence with respect to the underlying returns of real estate projects. Stabilised RERA implantation will enhance the predictability of earnings and project cash flows, and hence, prompt them to consider equity option as well," said Neeraj Sharma, director at Grant Thornton Advisory, a global consultancy firm.  "Equity money will be back in the market. It will be a challenge for builders to get higher returns as they may not find the right partners. There will be a huge demand for liquidity as sales have considerably slowed down," said Ravindra Pai, MD, Century Real Estate Holdings.</description>

			<title>Now, generate own power for price of a phone</title>
			<description>NEW DELHI: Solar panels on the rooftop that produce a kilowatt of power are no longer beyond the reach of ordinary citizens. Such a project will cost around Rs 60,000, even less if the central government's 30% subsidy is factored in. In fact, generating the energy to run two fans and two lights could come at the price of a high-end smartphone.  The investment of around Rs 50,000 on putting up the solar panels would have a payback period of around three years. Till a year ago, generating each kilowatt of solar power cost upward of Rs 90,000.  "Over the past 6-7 years, the prices of solar modules have fallen 85%," said Jasmeet Khurana, associate director (consulting), Bridge to India, a consultancy specialising in renewable energy. "This slide, coupled with increasing volumes, has led to the price crash."  This has led to the notion that only large commercial projects stood to gain economically from solar power swiftly changing.  A kilowatt is equivalent to around 1400 units of power in a year, and the installed system would have a life of 25 years.  All this requires is a shadowfree space of at least 120 square feet on the roof. The potential for rooftop solar power in the capital is 2200 MW; Delhi's peak power demand is around 6,600 MW.  The spokesperson of Tata Power Delhi Distribution Limited (TPDDL) told TOI, "Tapping solar power has become easier because the discoms now provide services such as installing net meters and facilitating subsidies." TPDDL, which caters to north and north-west Delhi, today has 150 domestic and commercial consumers who have installed projects with a capacity of 7 MW on their rooftops.  BSES Delhi, the capital's other discom, has around 300 solar rooftop generators, who produce 10 MW. "Consumers have begun to see how rooftop solar power generation reduces their electricity bills," said an official of the utility.  Against around Rs 90,000 per kilowatt earlier, the Solar Energy Corporation of India now says the average cost in Delhi under a 500MW grid-connected project of a size bigger than 25kWp is just Rs 66,000."  The payback period could be shorter if Delhi government's generation-based incentive of Rs 2 per unit offered for the first three years is taken into consideration.  Commercial establishments, which are not entitled to this incentive, can still cut down on their energy expenses by opting for solar power generation.  "Mid-sized commercial projects will also gain from the accelerated depreciation of 40% and income-tax benefit for their capital investment," said the TPDDL spokesperson.  Power department officials said the completion of vendor empanelment in a few weeks will facilitate consumers taking up rooftop projects.  Pujarini Sen, campaigner for Greenpeace India, is happy with this. "Solar power is financially reliable and is simultaneously a step in the fight against air pollution," she said. "India has an ambitious target of 100GW of renewable energy by 2022, and all of us, as citizens, have a role to play in that."</description>

			<title>IGI choked: No new peak-hour flights in Delhi this summer</title>
			<description> NEW DELHI: Indians may be flying like never before but the infrastructure crunch at metro airports is limiting their choice of flights. The problem is so acute that putting an additional flight in peak hours is becoming tough at most metros.  Delhi airport, for instance, will not be adding a single flight between 7am and 10pm this summer.  Airlines are pleading with Mumbai airport to allow more domestic flights at night as the airport has no additional slots left.  These two airports alone accounted for almost 10 crore of the total (domestic-cum-international) traffic of just over 15 crore last year.  The severe infrastructure crunch at major Indian airports was highlighted during recent deliberations aviation authorities held with airlines to finalise the summer schedule this year.  The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) cleared a summer schedule of 17,170 domestic flights a week from 77 airports by 12 airlines.  TOI accessed the minutes of the meeting, prepared by the Airports Authority of India (AAI), which reveals that big airports are bursting at the seams. So much so that airlines have ordered hundreds of planes but no one knows where they will be parked.  The Delhi airport's representative said at the meeting that "no new flights are being accepted from 7am to 10pm as Delhi airport is full during that period".  Delhi is the only airport in India that has three runways but due to airside infrastructure crunch, the hourly aircraft movement remains way below potential.  The minutes say that while the maximum hourly capacity of IGI Airport's three runways is 75 aircraft (70 schedule and 5 non-schedule), the "practical hourly capacity to be considered for allocation of slots" is much less at 67 (62 schedule and 5 non-schedule).  A reduction of eight schedule flights means 192 fewer flights a day. With two IGI runways (when one is closed for repairs), the hourly capacity is between 45 and 60.  Also between 11pm and 6am, it can handle a maximum of 45 flights an hour due to special runway usage procedure to cut on night-time noise from planes The Mumbai airport representative admitted that his was a "constrained airport".  On its part, AAI admitted that the "runway capacity (aircraft handling) of airports is the same as the past season".  Airlines are seething as they had been ordering planes but the big airports don't have slots for additional flights or even adequate parking stands.  According to the minutes, Neville Mehta of Jet Airways said: "There needs to be a way forward to increase air traffic movement at metros especially Delhi and Bengaluru... given the status of airport infrastructure almost across the country and with no immediate solution in sight, airlines have no room to either expand or manoeuvre their schedules/network commensurate with passenger growth."  The minutes quote Debashis Saha of SpiceJet saying: "There has been no increase in runway capacity at major airports.  Delhi remains a major concern with just 62 movements an hour and both AAI and DIAL (Delhi International Airport Pvt Ltd) have indicated no new slots at Delhi Airport between 7am and 10pm.  Mumbai continues to remain capacitated and Chennai, Kolkata, Bengaluru are also capacitated in peak hours.  There is a real capacity constraint in Mumbai... to procure slots, MIAL (Mumbai International Airport Pvt Ltd ) should look into allowing domestic airlines on regular basis to operate late night flights.</description>

			<title>What’s up ahead: Nifty likely to stay buoyant, but is nearing consolidation</title>
			<description>By Milan Vaishnav, CMT  Strong uptrend continued in the Indian equities market on Thursday, as the benchmark Nifty50 index opened higher and spent the entire session maintaining the gains and the Nifty50 ending the day with net gains of 68.90 points or 0.76 per cent.  Technically, there are bright chances that we see a modestly positive opening on Friday and the Nifty50 continues with its upward move, marking fresh highs. At this juncture, it is very much evident that global liquidity is fuelling markets and under such conditions it is normal for markets to trade in the overbought territory for some time. But on the daily charts, lead indicators look a bit overstretched. At the same time, the Nifty rests at an important pattern resistance on the weekly charts.  Given this, there is no doubt that the upward move of the Nifty will continue. At the same time, we need to exercise a higher level of caution going ahead. It would be imperative for the market to consolidate and then move higher again. General buoyancy is very much likely to remain intact.  On Friday, the 9,195 and 9,265 levels are likely to offer resistance to the market. Supports appear much lower at 9,105 and 9,020 levels. The Relative Strength Index, or RSI, on the daily chart stands at 76.9629 and it has reached its highest value in last 14 periods, which is a bullish indication. However, it continues to trade in the overbought territory.  Nifty March futures show further addition of over 7.63 lakh shares or 3.02 per cent in Open Interest. This clearly presents a buoyant picture and evidently displays underlying buoyancy in the market.  Pattern analysis shows the Nifty50 has achieved a clear breakout from its major pattern area resistance levels. This breakout has been achieved with a breakaway gap. This occurring with high volumes shows the strength of the breakout. Further strength in the market is displayed by the fact that the Nifty is not giving up the gains and oscillating in a capped range instead of seeing any major correction.  Though we disregard the overbought structure of the market, we need to understand that being “overbought” does not mean weakness. It is, in fact a clear evidence and result of the strength. It simply means that the upward move may get halted at some time and the Nifty then consolidates in a defined range only to move higher.  At this juncture, we categorically advise investors to refrain from creating shorts even at higher levels as the upward momentum remains absolutely intact. Barring some capped and rangebound consolidation which might happen at later stage, such activity should be used to make sectoral purchases. Effective sector rotation will hold the key for future gains for the market participants.  STOCKS TO WATCH:  1. Inox Wind: We recommend to buy and accumulate Inox Wind at every decline with target of Rs 250. After marking highs near Rs 490-495 levels, the stock has been in a structural downtrend and has spent more than a year and a half in a falling channel. Off late,  The stock has been showing signs of trend reversal. The RSI is bullish marking fresh 14-period high other lead indicators remain in continuing buy mode. Upward momentum is likely to resume in this stock. (Any call on this above the prescribed level would be positional and not intraday.)  2. Bajaj Holdings and Investments: We recommend to accumulate this stock above Rs 2,115 with a target of Rs 2,350. After taking support at its 200-DMA in the recent corrective action, it has been in upward rising channel since then. Currently it has formed a congestion zone while consolidating in a capped range. The upward momentum is likely to resume in this stock. The lead indicators show positive divergence against the price while lead indicators showing likely resumption of upward momentum. (Any call on this above the prescribed level would be positional and not intraday.)

			<title>Chasing new highs: Strong liquidity to fuel further gains in select stocks</title>
			<description>Nifty crossed the 9,000-level on Monday after almost two years. During this period, over 1,000 stocks outperformed the broader indices with some large caps like Bajaj Finserve, Bajaj Finance, HPCL, Petronet LNG, Piramal Enterprises and India Oil doubling, while mid-cap stocks like Jubilant Life, Chennai Petroleum and Aegis Logistics, among others, fetched 400% returns. After the rally, many of them are at record highs, mirroring the Nifty levels, yet analysts are betting on more action in these stocks, thanks to the unabated liquidity flows.      </description>

			<title>Google adds tool to flag 'offensive' search results</title>
			<description>NEW YORK: Google is trying to improve the quality of its search results by directing review teams to flag content that might come across as upsetting or offensive.  With the change, content with racial slurs could now get flagged under a new category called "upsetting-offensive." So could content that promotes hate or violence against a specific group of people based on gender, race or other criteria.  While flagging something doesn't directly affect the search results themselves, it's used to tweak the company's software so that better content ranks higher. This approach might, for instance, push down content that is inaccurate or has other questionable attributes, thereby giving prominence to trustworthy sources.  The review teams - comprised of contractors known as "quality raters" - already comb through websites and other content to flag questionable items such as pornography. Google added "upsetting-offensive" in its latest guidelines for quality raters. Google declined to comment on the changes, which were reported in the blog Search Engine Land and elsewhere.  The guidelines , which run 160 pages, are an interesting look into how Google ranks the quality of its search results. For instance, it gives examples of "high-quality" pages, such as the home page of a newspaper that has "won seven Pulitzer Prize awards," and "low-quality" pages, such as an article that includes "many grammar and punctuation errors."  The guidelines cite an example of "Holocaust history" as a search query. A resulting website listing "Top 10 reasons why the holocaust didn't happen" would get flagged.  The new "upsetting-offensive" flag instructs quality raters to "flag to all web results that contain upsetting or offensive content from the perspective of users in your locale, even if the result satisfies the user intent." So even if the results are what the person searched for, such as white supremacist websites, they could still get flagged. But it doesn't mean the results won't show up at all when someone searches for them.</description>
